# ZetCraftMod

A forge mod for Minecraft 1.18.2 designed for use in my own modpack(s).

Inclusion in other modpacks is allowed, though many of the things this mod does (or will do) are going to be very polarizing and/or incomplete without other mods to supplement it.

Basically: This mod exists so I can implement things into my modpack(s) that would otherwise be extremely tedious/impossible.
The simpler items and blocks are included only for my own convenience.
